## Reproduced from ICLR 2020 paper titled "What Can Neural Networks Reason About?"
ICLR Submission: https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxbJeHFPS

In this report, we have reproduced the original findings of the paper “What Can Neural Networks Reason About?” in ICLR 2020, published by Keyulu Xu et al. The main idea behind the original paper is to develop a theoretical framework to characterize which reasoning tasks a network can learn well, by studying how well its computation structure aligns with the algorithmic structure of the relevant reasoning process.
